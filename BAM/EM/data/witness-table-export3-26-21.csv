(Brill, 2018)","In the year 303 I saw in the city of Iṣṭakhr of the land of Fārs a large book in the possession of a member of one of the noble families. It contained many kinds of their sciences (ʿulūm), stories of their kings and their buildings and ways of rule, things which I have not found in any other of the Persians’ books, such as the Khudāynāmāh, Āyīnnāmāh, Kahnāmāh,
or others. It contained the pictures of the Sasanian kings of Fārs, twenty-seven rulers, twenty-five of them male and two women. Each was depicted as
he was the day he died, whether old or young, with his decorations and
crown, the plaits of his beard and the features of his face. They ruled the
world for 433 years, one month and seven days.
When one of their kings died they used to draw his likeness and take it
to the treasury, so that the living among them would know the features of the dead. The pictures of those kings who had been in war were (represented) standing, and the pictures of those that had been in (peaceful) rule were (represented) seated. The way of life of each one of them (was told in this book) with its private and public details and the notable events and important occasions that had taken place during their rule. The date of this book is that it was written on the basis of what was
found in the treasury of the kings of Fārs in the middle of Jumādā II in the year 113 (731) and translated (nuqila) for Hishām ibn ʿAbd al-Malik ibn
Marwān from Persian into Arabic.
The first of their kings in this book was Ardashīr, whose sign (shiʿār) in
his picture was red-golden and he wore trousers of the colour of the sky
and his crown was green on gold. He had a spear in his hand and he was
standing. The last of them was Yazdajird ibn Shahriyār ibn Kisrā Abarwīz,
whose sign was green with ornaments (akhḍar muwashshā) and he wore
embroidered trousers of the colour of the sky and his crown was red. He
was standing with a spear in his hand leaning against his sword. (The
book and the portraits were painted) in Persian colours, the like of which
are no longer found, using liquid gold and silver, and powdered copper.
The paper was purple and wonderfully coloured, though I am not sure as
to whether it was paper or parchment because it was so beautiful and so
perfectly made.
